Well, you are, right? |    I knew I was going through the same process, but I'm not going into it now because it's so much easier. |  But we need to ask that the hiring managers do not overvalue the experience of being in an organization with many women. |  Yes.)

One of my favorite lines in "Parks and Recreation" is "We're all human."
