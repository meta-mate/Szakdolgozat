Node(Name: dllist([0]), Values: In a cosmos where temporality flows like braided rivers and mnemonic fragments coalesce into luminous constellations, there exists a metropolis named Everspan—a protean labyrinth of mutable thoroughfares and monumental spires that ascend into an eternal crepuscular firmament. | The denizens of this enigmatic city, known as Echoes, are the vestigial remnants of antecedent decisions, extracted from the manifold realities that have either perished or remain unrealized. | These beings drift aimlessly, seeking purpose within the city's confines yet constrained by their inability to recall their origins. | At Everspan’s epicenter stands the Loom, an intricate apparatus that orchestrates the city's ontological fabric and its inhabitants' ephemeral existences. | Pulsing with the latent energy of forgotten narratives, the Loom inscribes elaborate motifs in threads of radiance and obscurity. | While some assert that the Loom possesses an intrinsic sentience, subtly responding to the Echoes’ agency to reconfigure Everspan, others contend it has succumbed to dysfunction, endlessly reiterating obsolete schemata and entrapping the Echoes within recursive cycles. | An anomalous event disturbs this precarious equilibrium when an Echo named Syll perceives a rupture within the city's fabric. | This breach defies conventional dichotomies of light and shadow, manifesting as an indescribable phenomenon imbued with a cadence resembling a heartbeat. | Upon initiating contact with the tear, Syll precipitates its expansion, unveiling ephemeral visions of alternate iterations of Everspan—visions that oscillate between unrealized potential and irrevocable entropy. | This act catalyzes the involvement of two other Echoes: Lir, whose fractured recollections intimate a life antecedent to Everspan, and Cael, who professes an esoteric comprehension of the Loom’s cryptic mechanics. | The expanding rupture engenders ontological instability throughout Everspan. | Thoroughfares collapse into voids of nonexistence, and towering spires disintegrate into scintillating particulate. | The Echoes fracture into ideological factions: some interpret the anomaly as an emancipatory aperture, while others perceive it as an existential menace. | Resolute in their quest for resolution, Syll, Lir, and Cael embark on an odyssey toward the Loom, conjecturing that it harbors the means to comprehend and address the anomaly. | Their expedition reveals phenomena that transcend the city’s paradigmatic logic, confronting them with paradoxes that recontextualize their self-conceptions and the fundamental nature of Everspan. | Their traversal becomes an iterative negotiation with the Loom, wherein each decision—whether to engender, obliterate, or transcend—reverberates throughout the city’s ontology, dynamically reconstituting its form. | Syll discerns that the tear embodies not merely an aberration but an inquiry: What constitutes autonomy in a domain governed by inscrutable determinism? | Lir grapples with the anguish of recollection, recognizing that liberation from Everspan may necessitate her ontological dissolution. | Meanwhile, Cael’s ambition to rectify the Loom evolves into an understanding that perfection is not synonymous with restoration but rather with metamorphosis. | Upon reaching the Loom, the trio confronts a pivotal juncture: to sever the threads and permit Everspan to dissipate into an unbounded void or to interweave their unique patterns into its fabric, thereby redefining the city's essence. | In this climactic revelation, the Loom is unveiled not as an external mechanism but as an intrinsic emanation of their collective agency. | Weaving becomes an act of introspection, wherein definition and transformation converge. | Ultimately, Everspan evades binary outcomes of preservation or annihilation. | It emerges as an evolving construct, shaped by deliberate choices and permeated with uncertainty. | The Echoes, no longer constrained by their prior identities, embrace a state of indeterminacy, their essences inextricably interwoven with the transformed city. | The Loom endures, perpetually weaving and unraveling, a testament to the inexhaustible potential of creative agency within an ever-fluid reality.)

Everspans are a sort of mirror image of the real world, the place where the world is made up of distinct entities. | 

As they drift, they find themselves caught in the midst of a strange, multidimensional, and unknowable wave of change, that they cannot understand. |  Eclipsed by the labyrinthine labyrinths, the inhabitants are trapped in a single realm—the realm of the unknown. | 

The Loo is a place that is both a laboratory for the art of re-creation and a storehouse for its subjects. | 

Everspans are a large, complex and complex city that spans millennia and spans many regions. |  This is a natural occurrence, as the lama-noun of Evespan has always been associated with a single, self-sufficient living entity. |  Within the rift, a self-imposed "warp" is unleashed. |  A second Loid, a lesser-known Loids, emerge from this rupture and are in the process of reconfiguring the world through their own fractal, multidimensional designs. | The NFL's decision to move its domestic violence investigation to a team in San Francisco last week prompted a furious response from NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. |  Celsus and Sartori's investigations of Echoes are a first step toward unraveling the mysteries of these portals, while Sylla's investigation of Cel's remains is a follow-up to their first. |  Celsus and his followers, in the course of their research, find themselves unable to explain the workings of L'initiate's seething, disquieting and seemingly impossible to understand. |  As the events in Echoes' story unfold, their collective narratives diverge on the crucial issue of whether the Breach of Souls is a continuation of a collective and moral imperative or a new epoch of transcendence. | AUSTIN, Texas -- The Texas Legislature has approved a bill that would require private school districts to have a policy of hiring transgender students, according to a report. |  To the Echo, a new and unprecedented form of temporal transference is the Eternality, but to Cel, it is an alternate reality in which a selfhood emerges from a closed system of knowledge, its eternal origin as a single entity. |  Ears of anguish and anguish, in turn, fill Evespan's metaphorical void, as the shards of shattered shards converge on the Eternals. |  The Lox, for its part, has been subjected to a temporal breakdown that renders it impossible to transcend its ontologically-determined origins—for now, Everpan stands as a pre-eminent manifestation of its transcendent form, a world-form of which Sylla and Lion are unaware. |  Celael's epiphany is interrupted by the shattering realization that she is in fact a ghost. |  She has entered into a symbiotic relationship with Sylla, in exchange for his help in the unfolding of her epiphany. |  When the duo reaches the top of The Lomos, they are met by the powerful Lava, a monstrous form of black impregnated with impenetrable barriers, that is, its own inner self. | As of January, 2016, I am the only member of my family to live in this country. |

As we've seen in the past, there's a lot of good news on the Republican side. |  In the wake of Syria's bloody civil war, and the end of their regime's support for the Syrian opposition and its support of al-Qaeda, a new war is looming. |   I think it's very possible that there is some truth to this. |  In the first two weeks of November, Russia was seen as the most likely candidate to win the presidential election. |  I'd like that in any candidate. |  (And he also used the phrase "Russia's aggression" to describe the U.S. on Tuesday night, a day before Trump was due to make his first press conference since being sworn in.) |  'I'm not going to believe this,' Trump said last week on Twitter. |  It's not just any campaign. |  It's a good idea. |  And the president's wife, Melania Trump, has said that she is 'very angry' about it." |  We've been told that the man has a criminal record and has never been convicted of any crime.)

Node(Name: dllist([1]), Values:  Mike Huckabee has been very vocal on this, saying that the NCAA has "an obligation" to "put a stop to this kind of thing," and he's already been talking about how the game is "not just for kids but for everyone." |  That means the state has to be ready to work with a large state, like Arkansas, to find and fix that problem. |  I've also been told that the State Department is looking into the issue, but there's not much we can do about it at this point. | 

I spoke with two people that worked on the project with Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. |  I've seen Trump lose the election and think he is a failure in the eyes of many. |  I think the real question is whether or not the Trump campaign is going to have the resources and the support to make the case that they're going in the right direction. |  We've had some very interesting discussions in the past about the direction of our campaign and about how we could use our new president to help our country grow. |  And it was also the most successful of his campaign. |   The same is true of Clinton, who seems to think her campaign was trying too hard to please Trump. |  And then you can say, 'You know what, let's go back to doing it this way.'" |  We don' know how to solve it.)

The NCAA also has the power to suspend players for a game that "inadvertently" happens, and that means that if the players play, they could be banned for up to a week. | 

The problem is, the SEC is not doing anything about the problem at all. |  Both said that they think there are too many problems with the process. |  We are in an era where the president is not only losing the popular vote but also the Electoral College, which is how he has a hard time winning the presidency. |  But they've been pretty vague about what they would do and what would they do. |  There are some things that we are doing well that will make us very successful in our own country. | The first time I heard about this was in a post that I wrote about when I was a junior at the University of Alabama. |  She's been accused of being a hypocrite, she's said she would not be a good president, and she has made it clear she doesn't care about those things. |

 (1) A student is allowed to play (2) a team for no reason, (3) and (4) at the discretion of the university, but the school can also suspend a student for any reason without giving him a chance to challenge his decision. |  The NCAA, of course, has a number of different ways it can suspend people for games, like the one we discussed earlier. |  You're doing the right thing for us. |  But we also need the community to not be afraid to make changes and keep doing this.' |  That's how it works. |  And I think it really helps our kids and our families. |  —Mike Huckabee

And, of course, some of us want to see those players win. | 

It's not just about the NCAA's rule. |  (5) The student will be deemed ineligible to attend the game and the suspension can be appealed. |  If the NCAA feels that a specific team is guilty of misconduct, then the student has the right to appeal that decision and can do so. |  I would recommend not doing that. | 

It sounds like a lot of people, including myself, feel that this is too much to ask. | 

There's more to the story here. | 

If you want to go further, here are some ways to help. | It's been four weeks since the Supreme Court struck down the Voting Rights Act, and the administration of President Obama has been more than willing to deny the rights of millions of people to vote. |  We've also created a social media tool to let kids know where they should go if their school has to suspend them.)
Node(Name: dllist([1]), Values: Sebastian Tadic has revealed his plans for the future, but he doesn't want the same team he's in now. |  It's about all of the way the sport of basketball is playing. |  (6) If the student fails to appear and be present in the scheduled time frame, the school may discipline the player for the violation. |  For example, if the college team denies a violation of the rule, the team's suspension may be reduced to one. |  But there are a few things that can happen if that happens. |  My kids, my wife, our kids are all still in high school. |  It's interesting to note that the University of Utah and other NCAA teams have been taking steps to address the issue of sexual assault in college athletics. | This is a rush transcript. |  The administration is also taking a hard line on voting rights, even as it's trying to keep its own election results under wraps. |  So if your school is in the process of making a decision about whether to reinstate you or not, please let them know.)
Node(Name: dllist([1]), Values:  And the team that he represents, the Brooklyn Nets, has no intention of losing. |  In other words, if the coach of a team is absent for a game, then the team's coaches are not allowed to participate. |  This means that the NCAA may not issue a team suspension for an opponent's violation, even if it doesn't specifically mention the opponent. |  The team may have to sign a new player to another team, and the NCAA will determine who's allowed to play. |  I think they're going to go to college. |  One of them is the "No Sexual Assault" law. |  Copy may not be in its final form. |  We've seen that in other states, like Arkansas. |  We have a lot of work to do.)
Node(Name: dllist([1]), Values: 

The Nets have made it clear that they don't care what happens in the playoffs. | 

The NCAA has a new rule, which states that if a coach is suspended for violating the rules of the game by a school that is in violation of an NCAA rule (or a rule that doesn
"may reasonably be expected to be followed"), the school can appeal to a state appellate court. |  If the game does not end up being a success, there's no way to stop the program from using a player, or even the league, to promote a specific player. | 

The NBA is not going away, however. |  No one likes to be arrested for rape, but when you see a guy who is a predator in the middle of the night, like a former girlfriend, you want to say to him, "Hey, I'm not going anywhere, just stay away from me." | 

A team can only suspend one person for five games. |  But the law is not designed to make it easier for some people to commit rape. | 

It's not the first time the NBA has been accused of sexual assault.)
Node(Name: dllist([1]), Values:  The appellate judge will decide if the university should appeal, or not. |  If it does, that player can't play again, so he or she can stay in school and earn more money. |  The league has been fighting this issue since the last major league game, with the National Basketball Association (NBA) taking a stand against the rule and trying to get it reversed. |   That's what the NCAA wants. |  That means that the team that makes the decision to suspend the player is the one that has the discretion to send him back to school for his punishment. |  It's designed for the rest of us. |  The last time was in 1999, when the St. Louis Blues were fined $500,000 for an incident in which a 15-year-old girl was forced to perform oral sex on them.)
