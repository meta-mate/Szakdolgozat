Node(Name: dllist([0]), Values:  As with previous Valkyira Chronicles games, Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role-playing game where players take control of a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces. |  Stories are told through comic book-like panels with animated character portraits, with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text. |  The player progresses through a series of linear missions, gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked. |  The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player's approach: when one option is selected, the other is sealed off to the player. |  Outside missions, the player characters rest in a camp, where units can be customized and character growth occurs. |  Alongside the main story missions are character-specific sub missions relating to different squad members. |  After the game's completion, additional episodes are unlocked, some of them having a higher difficulty than those found in the rest of the game. |  There are also love simulation elements related to the game's two main heroines, although they take a very minor role. | 
 The game's battle system, the BliTZ system, is carried over directly from Valkyira Chronicles. |  During missions, players select each unit using a top-down perspective of the battlefield map: once a character is selected, the player moves the character around the battlefield in third-person. |  A character can only act once per-turn, but characters can be granted multiple turns at the expense of other characters' turns. |  Each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their Action Gauge. |  Up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission. |  During gameplay, characters will call out if something happens to them, such as their health points (HP) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks. |  Each character has specific "Potentials", skills unique to each character. |  They are divided into "Personal Potential", which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character, and "Battle Potentials", which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character. |  To learn Battle Potentials, each character has a unique "Masters Table", a grid-based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills. |  Characters also have Special Abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield: Kurt can activate "Direct Command" and move around the battlefield without depleting his Action Point gauge, the character Reila can shift into her "Valkyria Form" and become invincible, while Imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon. | 
 Troops are divided into five classes: Scouts, Shocktroopers, Engineers, Lancers and Armored Soldier. |  Troopers can switch classes by changing their assigned weapon. |  Changing class does not greatly affect the stats gained while in a previous class. |  With victory in battle, experience points are awarded to the squad, which are distributed into five different attributes shared by the entire squad, a feature differing from early games' method of distributing to different unit types.)
Node(Name: dllist([1]), Values:  The game is rated R for technical difficulties. |  A series that is well-developed, well presented, and well executed is V. |  During the first mission, players must complete the mission in order to gain access to certain areas of the world, which can only be accessed through the main story. |  This is an interesting concept as it allows players to create their own unique characters without the need of the game's manual. |  Some missions even have playable characters that are playable in their own story and some missions feature playable character models. |  These episodes can vary in length, difficulty, and the number of missions the story begins with, but they all have the same goal: to make the world a better place. | 

The story of Valkyrie: Rise of Valkyrie will be available on February 18th for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. |  It is controlled by a computer, and is not currently available in English. |  It is possible to use the same player to fight or to play with different units, making it easier to create your own. |  Certain characters in Vyria have a special ability called "Bli TZ," which grants them special abilities, such as the ability to become a single unit in battle. |  To avoid confusion, when an enemy unit is destroyed, a player character appears in front of him for the next round. |  Characters can move through the field at will, and have their movement speed increased or decreased by one, depending upon their Speed Gauges. |  Characters can also be given a limited number of turns, which can help reduce the time required to complete a mission (up to four turns) or to return to battle (four turns). The BliiTz system is the basis for the "Battle System" of V4. |  If the given character doesn't perform a certain action, they must select another character and perform that action from the field. |  While the players are allowed to choose their own Battle Potions, they cannot choose one from a set of five. |  Unlike most other V-Rays, which require a high level of skill, Battlepotentials can also be learned from a variety of sources and are learned as soon as a player takes control. |  These special abilities are the "Power Overwhelming", "Absolute Power Over Strength", and the Battle Powers "Ultimate Power". Each of these powers is unique for each player, though the effects vary based on their character's abilities, skills, or abilities. |  Troopers are trained to be more effective at attacking enemy infantry and armor, especially when deployed on a large scale. |  All units are trained in their own special abilities that are determined by story progression. |  In addition, there are special abilities that allow the unit to move and attack at will, granting bonus points to their stats and abilities. |  Unlike earlier games where the players were given five ranks of Leadership, Troop 1 is awarded a bonus rank of "Leader", whereas Trop 2 is given a rank equal to "Spy" or "Surgeon". Trooper units have a special ability called "Pumpkin", and its cost is reduced by 1.)

In the second mission of this game, you can complete a story that takes place after the previous mission. | How do I learn to be a journalist? |  The story itself will feature a special series called The Adventure of Valkyria Chronicles, where players will fight against the evil empire of Lord Beelzebub. |  The title will also be released as a downloadable content. |  The story will also be updated with new content, including new playable units for the playable heroes, new enemies, more and more battles, characters with more special powers, or new special moves. |  The player can then select which unit he wishes to attack, using the "Attack!" button on the unit. |  Players can also use their unit's Special Ability to attack, or use it to change the direction of their current attack. |  The main features of this system are the following:

These cards contain various special units that can be trained and used to combat the enemy. |  The Battle Power "Tower of Doom" can be used to increase the strength of enemy units or increase their speed, while "Eternal Power" allows for a unit's armor to regenerate. | 75 times that of other Troops.)
