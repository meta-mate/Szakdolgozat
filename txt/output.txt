Node(Name: dllist([0]) Values: Before the formation of Alice in Chains, then-drummer Layne Staley landed his first gig as a vocalist when he auditioned to sing for a local glam metal band known as Sleze after receiving some encouragement from his stepbrother Ken Elmer. | Other members of this group at that time were guitarists Johnny Bacolas and Zoli Semanate, drummer James Bergstrom, and bassist Byron Hansen. | This band went through several lineup changes culminating with Nick Pollock as their sole guitarist and Bacolas switching to bass before discussions arose about changing their name to Alice in Chains. | This was prompted by a conversation that Bacolas had with a singer from another band about backstage passes. | Due to concerns over the reference to female bondage, the group ultimately chose to spell it differently as Alice N' Chains to allay any parental concerns, though Staley's mother Nancy McCallum has said she was still not happy with this name at first. | Staley met guitarist Jerry Cantrell while working with Alice N' Chains at Music Bank rehearsal studios. | The two struggling musicians became roommates, living in a rehearsal space they shared. | Alice N' Chains soon disbanded, and Staley joined a funk band that also required a guitarist at the time. | Staley asked Cantrell to join as a sideman. | Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join Cantrell's band, which at the time included drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Starr. | Eventually the funk project broke up, and in 1987 Staley joined Cantrell's band on a full-time basis, playing in clubs around the Pacific Northwest, often stretching 15 minutes of material into a 45-minute set. | The band played a couple of gigs, calling themselves different monikers, including Diamond Lie, the name of Cantrell's previous band, before eventually adopting the name that Staley's previous band had initially flirted with, Alice in Chains. | Local promoter Randy Hauser became aware of the band at a concert and offered to pay for demo recordings. | However, one day before the band was due to record at the Music Bank studio in Washington, police shut down the studio during the biggest cannabis raid in the history of the state.)

Stalwell wrote about the role the Beatles played on this album in a story of his own. | It wasn't until after this meeting that the group finally made it out of Alice in Chains without even a trace of irony. | One year later the group was set to take the final road trip of their lives to Mexico and perform at Bonnaroo. | He said the only way it had ever existed was if a band had existed with the same name, even if both played different songs.)
